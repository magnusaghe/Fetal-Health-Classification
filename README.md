# Abstract 
This project uses the Random Forest model to classify the health of a fetus using Cardiotocography data as one of three groups:- Normal, Suspect, or Pathological. The model has an 87.88% accuracy.
Developed by Magnus Aghe as part of the Machine Learning Deployment course ANA680 at National University, San Diego, CA.
The model uses five predictors namely Prolongued Decelerations, Percentage of time with abnormal long term variability, Accelerations, Histogram Variance, and Uterine Contractions. 
Dataset used is Fetal Health Classification Dataset obtained from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification/data
